## Apologia

Apologia is a Christ-centered sermon refinement platform inspired by
1 Peter 3:15 — “Always be ready to give a defense (apologia) for the hope that is in you.”

The purpose of Apologia is to assist pastors and teachers in carefully
reviewing, refining, and preserving sermon content without altering doctrine
or theological intent.

### Core Principles
- Assist, never replace the pastor
- Preserve theological accuracy
- Maintain Scripture integrity
- Provide transparent, review-based suggestions
- Support future apologetics and teaching use

### MVP Focus
The initial version of Apologia focuses on:
- Uploading sermon PowerPoint files
- Slide-by-slide proofreading suggestions
- Grammar and spelling correction
- Scripture reference validation (non-destructive)
- Pastor-controlled acceptance or rejection of changes
- Downloading the updated sermon file
- Basic sermon storage and retrieval

### Future Vision
Apologia will expand to support:
- Sermon tagging and categorization
- Apologetics-oriented content compilation
- Multi-sermon document and PDF generation
- Teaching and archival use cases

> Apologia exists to serve the faithful transmission of the Word — not to redefine it.
